# HashiJS

A project to create an Javascript implementation of Hashiwokakero, built using Expo and React Native. The end goal is for a cross-platform app that can be played on iOS, Android, and desktop browser.

To build and run, install expo and react dependencies. I used `npx create-expo-app hashi-js` and `npx expo install react-native-web react-dom @expo/metro-runtime` to install dependencies.

Use npm run web from the hashi-js folder to start the web app.
